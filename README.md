# 🔎 SaaS Contract Risk Analyzer

B2B contracts are long, confusing, and written to protect the vendor.  
This tool reads the fine print for you — and tells you what to worry about.

## 💡 What It Does

- Upload a SaaS contract (PDF or TXT)
- Breaks it down clause by clause
- Flags who benefits: vendor / client / neutral
- Scores risk from 0.0 to 1.0
- Suggests how to make each clause better
- Outputs a full contract summary + CSV + JSON

- Smart clause segmentation
- Legal clause matching using embeddings
- Evaluated with Gemini 1.5 Pro
